2. License Grants and Conditions

   2.1. Grants

        Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
        license:

        a) under intellectual property rights other than Patent Claims, to use,
           reproduce, modify, display, perform, distribute, and sublicense the
           Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such rights apply to the
           Covered Software as a whole; and

        b) under Patent Claims to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,
           import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
           if any, in Source Code or Executable form. This patent license shall
           apply to the combination of the Contribution and Covered Software
           if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
           addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
           by the Patent Claims.

   2.2. Effective Date

        The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the
        date the Contributor first makes the Contribution available under the
        terms of this License.

   2.3. Limitations

        Except as expressly stated in this License, no right or license is granted
        to You, whether express or implied, by estoppel, or otherwise in or under
        any patents, trademarks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property rights
        of any Contributor.

   3.2. Modifications

        If You create or contribute to Modifications, You may distribute the
        Modifications only under the terms of this License.

4. Incompatible With Secondary Licenses

   If the Covered Software is made available under the terms described in Exhibit B
   of this License, then You may choose to comply with the terms of the Secondary
   License instead of this License for the Covered Software.

5. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind, either express
   or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties that the Covered Software
   is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
